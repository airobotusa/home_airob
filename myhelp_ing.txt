The find command recursively descends a directory locating all the files that meet the criteria given on the

	find path_name_list [options] 
	Where path_name_list is one or more directories. 
	% find . -name Makefile -print
	/home/huron2/admin/scot/tutorial/Makefile
	%
61. 
The compress command is used to reduce the size of a file. Compressions often save as much as 30-80 percent of
the original space, however you must uncompress files before they can be used. If file compression is possible the
suffix .Z will be added to the end of the file to indicate it it is compresses. 

% compress -v tut.tar
tut.tar: Compression: 78.19% -- replaced with tut.tar.Z
% ls -l tut.tar.Z
-rw-r--r--   1 scot     admin      79883 Mar 30 16:02 tut.tar.Z
%

The -v (verbose) option is used to list the amount of compression. 

The uncompress command has the same syntax as compress. 

% uncompress tut.tar.Z
% ls -l tut.tar
% ls -l tut.tar
-rw-r--r--   1 scot     admin     337920 Mar 30 16:02 tut.tar
%

Recently some sites have been using a new compression program. The GNU zip and unzip programs are being
used because they offer a more effective compression algorithm. The gzip (GNU zip) command will compress a
file and the gunzip (GNU unzip) will decompress a file. 

% gzip -v tut.tar
tut.tar:                 82.4% -- replaced with tut.tar.gz
%
